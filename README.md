# blinkt_effects

Animated light effects for the [Pimoroni Blinkt!](https://github.com/pimoroni/blinkt).

## Docs
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python rain.py
```
If the blinkt library is not installed (for instance when testing on PC, instead of a Raspberry Pi), 
the file `fake_blinkt.py` will be used instead, which simulates the effect by printing it to the console.
